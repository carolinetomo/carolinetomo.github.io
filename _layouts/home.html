  <p>  I am a computational evolutionary biologist. My research is focused on harnessing large-scale genomic and phenotypic datasets through the development of novel computational approaches to address fundamental evolutionary questions. I am particularly interested in understanding the macro- and microevolutionary processes and patterns underlying the emergence of novel phenotypic traits. This involves incorporating organismal complexity from the genomic to the ecological levels to better understand both the population-level and macroevolutionary processes that guide phenotypic innovation. Although my research sometimes brings me across the tree of life, I use fossil and living primates as my primary study system to address these questions, focusing most heavily on the Hominoidea (apes). By bringing novel computational approaches I am interested in harnassing the fossil record to illuminate broader issues in evolutionary theory. I am currently <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/caroline-parins-fukuchi/">TC Chamberlin Postdoctoral Fellow</a> in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago and incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.
