  <p> I am a computational evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. My research is focused on reconstructing evolutionary relationships to identify patterns in the emergence of novel suites of phenotypic traits and speciation mode among fosill taxa. An overarching goal in my research is to build an analytical framework that can effectively leverage emerging sources of large-scale morphological datasets to reconstruct evolutionary relationships and broad-scale patterns among fossil taxa. The underlying motivation in this work is to rebuild morphological phylogenetics and comparative analyses in ways that seek to carry paleobiology further into the genomic era to contribute to a cohesive and synthetic view of evolution that is informed by modern advances in the field. Much of this work involves the development of new methods and tools that accommodate data sources traditionally unconventional to phylogenetic inference, such as quantitative traits and stratigraphic/temporal ranges.
