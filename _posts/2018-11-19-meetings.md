Spoke at two great symposia this month: "Phylogenetic Paleobiology: Exploring Macroevolutionary Trends with Evolutionary Trees" at GSA 2018 in Indianapolis, and "Evolutionary and Phylogenetic Morphology" at Entomology 2018 in Vancouver. Good stuff! GSA slides are here: https://github.com/carolinetomo/GSA2018
