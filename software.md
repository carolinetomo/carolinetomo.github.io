#Software

I tend to develop most of my own tools. You should feel free to use any of them. I tend to leave documentation fairly sparse, so it would probably be best to get in touch with me if you are interested in using one of these.

_cophymaru_: https://github.com/carolinetomo/cophymaru

Golang package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference and fossil placement using continuous traits.

_mandos_: https://github.com/carolinetomo/mandos

Python library for phylogenetic analysis of stratigraphic ranges, continuous and discrete morphological traits that specialises in identifying direct ancestors using information criteria.

_greedo_: https://github.com/carolinetomo/cophycollapse

Parametric unsupervised learning of mosaic evolutionary structure in datasets of quantitative traits.
