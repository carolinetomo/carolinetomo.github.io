I tend to develop most of my own tools. My preferred programming languages for these are Golang (https://golang.org/) and Python/Cython. You should feel free to use any of them. Documentation can be a bit sparse (although the command line options for Golang executables should get you pretty far), so it would probably be best to get in touch with me if you are interested in using one of these.
