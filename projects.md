My work involves a lot of methodological development. However, this is done with the primary aim of addressing fundamental evolutionary questions pertaining to phylogenetic inference, mosaic evolution, and identifying speciation modes among fossil taxa (e.g., direct ancestry, anagenesis vs cladogenesis, and punctuated equilibria). To accommodate the vastness of life, I take a broad view across both plant and animal taxa, in hopes of understanding the fundamental evolutionary patterns that generate and maintain the diversity that we see today. 

## Morphological Evolution in Living and Fossil Plants

I am engaged in work seeking to identify the diversity in evolutionary pattern underlying the emergence of fruit, seed, and pollen diversity in the angiosperm families Vitaceae (grapes) and Icacinaceae. This involves measuring support and uncertainty for the phylogenetic placement of fossil taxa and identifying the relationships between evolutionary rates and disparity between quantitative measurements of reproductive organs, genomes, and climate niche.

## Mosaic Evolution in Fossil and Living Apes

In this work, I aim to characterize the diverity of evolutionary patterns that has contributed to the diverse locomotor and other autecological traits that emerged across the hominoid radiation from the Oligocene to the present. This involves developing and refining new tools to interrogate a large dataset of quantitative traits measured across anatomical regions for evolutionary modularity, or mosaicism.

## Rebuilding Morphological Phylogenetics

One major methodological theme involves building a set of statistical methods to reconstruct phylogeny from morphology and other phenotypic data measured quantitatively, rather than qualitatively. Historically, phylogenetic methods have been most throroughly developed for qualitative traits. This categorical treatment can lead to unique challenges when moving morphological phylogenetics into the statistical realm. This aspect to my work involves rebuilding morphological phylogenetics from the ground up, in order to improve some of these shortcomings and prepare a methodological framework through which to incorporate emerging platforms of rapid and thorough morphological quantification into phylogenetic inference.
