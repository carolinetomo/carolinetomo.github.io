I am interested in harnessing diverse approaches such as morphometrics, computational phylogenetics, and adaptive landscapes to address fundamental evolutionary questions using the fossil records and extant diversity of mammals. Much of my research aims to better understand the developmental, ecological, and evolutionary drivers underlying the emergence of morphological innovation in fossil and living great apes (including hominins). This has involved some work developing new approaches for reconstructing phylogeny, mosaic evolutionary patterns, and speciation modes (e.g., anagenesis vs "splitting" cladogenesis) from morphology, as well as specimen-based empirical work.

## Organismal integration, constraint, and innovation in apes

I aim to characterize the diverity of evolutionary patterns and developmental constraints that has contributed to the diverse locomotor and other autecological traits that emerged across the hominoid radiation from the Oligocene to the present. This involves both empirical work using museum specimens, and methodological work to develop methods that accommodate large quantitative morphological and developmental datasets. My research aims to synthesize observed patterns in large morphological, developmental, and ecological datasets to better understand the hierarchical and complex interactions that catalyze and constrain the emergence of phenotypic novelty. I seek to leverage the knowledge gained from these efforts to both illuminate specific questions regarding ape evolution, and contribute more broadly to our knowledge of evolutionary theory.

## Incorporating stratigraphic data in estimates of primate phylogeny

I am interested in evaluating stratigraphic and morphological evidence for ancestor-descendant relationships in primate phylogeny. Through the deployment of novel statistical phylogenetic approaches, I have contributed to an understanding of the quantitative landscape of support for ancestor-descendant relationships and anagenesis in hominins. I am currently working to generalize this work in hominins to better understand the temporal patterns in the phylogeny present in the primate fossil record.

## Rebuilding Morphological Phylogenetics

One major methodological theme involves building a set of statistical methods to reconstruct phylogeny from morphology and other phenotypic data measured quantitatively, rather than qualitatively. Historically, phylogenetic methods have been most throroughly developed for qualitative traits. This categorical treatment can lead to unique challenges when moving morphological phylogenetics into the statistical realm. This aspect to my work involves rebuilding morphological phylogenetics from the ground up, in order to improve some of these shortcomings and prepare a methodological framework through which to incorporate emerging platforms of rapid and thorough morphological quantification into phylogenetic inference.
