I develop new inferential approaches for genomic, phenotypic, and fossil evidence to understand emergence of phenotypic innovation. I am currently particularly interested in leveraging coalescent approaches to make inferences about past population processes driving episodes of major change. Much of my work uses Primates as a model system, but I also collaborate broadly to examine questions in other organisms, with a secondary major focus on plants.

## Phylogenomic discordance and processes of phenotypic evolution

I am broadly interested in understanding the evolutionary relationship between heterogeneous phylogenomic patterns, which are shaped by population-level processes, and patterns in the emergence of novel phenotypes. I have found that bursts in the rate at which new phenotypes evolve frequently correspond to epochs that also experience high discordance in phylogenetic signal across gene trees. I aim to extend this knowledge to better understand whether these corresponding patterns may be shaped by shared underlying population-level processes. I am also interested in exploring how population processes inferred under the coalescent interact with complex morphological patterns at both shallow and deep timescales.

## Organismal integration, constraint, and innovation

I aim to understand the diverity of evolutionary patterns and developmental constraints that have contributed to the diverse skeletal morphologies that emerged across the hominoid radiation from the Oligocene to the present. This involves both empirical work using museum specimens, and methodological work to develop methods that accommodate large quantitative morphological and developmental datasets. My research aims to synthesize observed patterns in large morphological, developmental, and ecological datasets to better understand the hierarchical and complex interactions that catalyze and constrain the emergence of phenotypic novelty. I seek to leverage the knowledge gained from these efforts to both illuminate specific questions regarding ape evolution, and contribute more broadly to our knowledge of evolutionary theory.
