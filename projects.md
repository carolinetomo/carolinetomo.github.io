My research aims to better understand the evolutionary drivers underlying the emergence of morphological innovation in fossil and living vertebrates, with particular interests in great apes (including hominins). This has involved some work developing new approaches for reconstructing phylogeny, mosaic evolutionary patterns, and speciation modes (e.g., anagenesis vs "splitting" cladogenesis) using morphological data.

## Mosaic evolution, constraint, and innovation in ape morphology

I aim to characterize the diverity of evolutionary patterns and developmental constraints that has contributed to the diverse locomotor and other autecological traits that emerged across the hominoid radiation from the Oligocene to the present. This involves both empirical work building digital data bases from museum specimens, and methodological work to develop methods that accommodate large quantitative morphological and developmental datasets. My research aims to synthesize observed patterns in large morphological, developmental, and ecological datasets to better understand the hierarchical and complex interactions that catalyze and constrain the emergence of phenotypic novelty. I seek to leverage the knowledge gained from these efforts to both illuminate specific questions regarding ape evolution, and contribute more broadly to our knowledge of evolutionary theory.

## Direct ancestry and anagenesis in vertebrate evolution

I am interested in evaluating evidence for directly ancestral relationships by combining continuous and discrete morphological data with stratigraphic data and parametric approaches to phylogenetic inference that I have developed. Rather than relying up on emerging Bayesian approaches that account for stratigraphic information, my approach to evaluating direct ancestry involves an information-theoretic reinterpretation of stratocladistics. I have applied this approach in hominins to reveal strong statistical support for direct ancestry between several key taxa that results in a phylogenetic tree that better reflects previous paleoanthropological interpretations of hominin evolutonary relationships.

## Rebuilding Morphological Phylogenetics

One major methodological theme involves building a set of statistical methods to reconstruct phylogeny from morphology and other phenotypic data measured quantitatively, rather than qualitatively. Historically, phylogenetic methods have been most throroughly developed for qualitative traits. This categorical treatment can lead to unique challenges when moving morphological phylogenetics into the statistical realm. This aspect to my work involves rebuilding morphological phylogenetics from the ground up, in order to improve some of these shortcomings and prepare a methodological framework through which to incorporate emerging platforms of rapid and thorough morphological quantification into phylogenetic inference.
